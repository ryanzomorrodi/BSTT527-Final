	abstract = {There are a number of arguments in support of early measures for the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as for concepts and strategies at later intervention stages. Diabetes prevention is achievable when implemented in a sustainable manner. Sustainability within a T2D prevention program is more important than the actual point in time or disease process at which prevention activities may start. The quality of intervention, as well as its intensity, should vary with the degree of the identified T2D risk. Nevertheless, preventive interventions should start as early as possible in order to allow a wide variety of relatively low- and moderate-intensity programs. The later the disease risk is identified, the more intensive the intervention should be. Public health interventions for diabetes prevention represent an optimal model for early intervention. Late interventions will be targeted at people who already have significant pathophysiological derangements that can be considered steps leading to the development of T2D. These derangements may be difficult to reverse, but the worsening of dysglycemia may be halted, and thus the clinical onset of T2D can be delayed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
              This study updates previous estimates of the economic burden of diagnosed diabetes, with calculation of the health resource use and indirect costs attributable to diabetes in 2022.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              We combine the demographics of the U.S. population in 2022 with diabetes prevalence, from national survey data, epidemiological data, health care cost data, and economic data, into a Cost of Diabetes Economic Model to estimate the economic burden at the population and per capita levels. Health resource use and associated medical costs are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbid condition, and health service category. Data sources include national surveys (2015–2020 or most recent available), Medicare standard analytic files (2020), and administrative claims data from 2018 to 2021 for a large commercially insured population in the U.S.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. in 2022 is \$412.9 billion, including \$306.6 billion in direct medical costs and \$106.3 billion in indirect costs attributable to diabetes. For cost categories analyzed, care for people diagnosed with diabetes accounts for 1 in 4 health care dollars in the U.S., 61\% of which are attributable to diabetes. On average people with diabetes incur annual medical expenditures of \$19,736, of which approximately \$12,022 is attributable to diabetes. People diagnosed with diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures 2.6 times higher than what would be expected without diabetes. Glucose-lowering medications and diabetes supplies account for ∼17\% of the total direct medical costs attributable to diabetes. Major contributors to indirect costs are reduced employment due to disability (\$28.3 billion), presenteeism (\$35.8 billion), and lost productivity due to 338,526 premature deaths (\$32.4 billion).
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              The inflation-adjusted direct medical costs of diabetes are estimated to rise 7\% from 2017 and 35\% from 2012 calculations (stated in 2022 dollars). Following decades of steadily increasing prevalence of diabetes, the overall estimated prevalence in 2022 remains relatively stable in comparison to 2017. However, the absolute number of people with diabetes has grown and contributes to increased health care expenditures, particularly per capita spending on inpatient hospital stays and prescription medications. The enormous economic toll of diabetes continues to burden society through direct medical and indirect costs.},

	abstract = {Background
              Reducing the occurrence of diabetes is considered a primary criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions for prediabetes. There is existing evidence that early lifestyle-based interventions can significantly decrease the incidence of diabetes. However, whether effective interventions can reduce long-term outcomes in patients, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risks, and the occurrence of microvascular complications, which are the most concerning issues for both patients and clinicians, remains a subject of inconsistent research findings. And there is no direct evidence to answer whether effective intervention has long-term benefits for prediabetic patients. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between early effective intervention and macrovascular and microvascular complications in prediabetic patients.
            
            
              Methods
              PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for the randomized controlled trials of lifestyle or/and drugs intervention in prediabetes from inception to 2023.9.15. Two investigators independently reviewed the included studies and extracted relevant data. Random or fixed effects model meta-analysis to derive overall relative risk (RR) with 95\% CI for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and microvascular complications.
            
            
              Results
              
                As of September 15, 2023, a total of 7 effective intervention studies were included, comprising 26 articles out of 25,671 articles. These studies involved 26,389 patients with a total follow-up duration of 178,038.6 person-years. The results indicate that effective intervention can significantly reduce all-cause mortality in prediabetic patients without a history of cardiovascular disease by 17\% (RR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.70-0.98). Additionally, effective intervention reduced the incidence of retinopathy by 38\% (RR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.70-0.98). Furthermore, the study results suggest that women and younger individuals have lower all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth analysis of patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. The results revealed that prediabetic patients with a 10-year cardiovascular risk \&gt;10\% experienced more significant benefits in terms of all-cause mortality (
                P
                =0.01). When comparing the results of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality from the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Outcome Study longitudinally, it was evident that the duration of follow-up is a key factor influencing long-term benefits. In other words, the beneficial effects become more pronounced as the intervention duration reaches a certain threshold.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Early effective intervention, which significantly reduces the incidence of diabetes, can effectively lower all-cause mortality in prediabetic patients without a history of cardiovascular disease (especially those with a 10-year cardiovascular risk \&gt;10\%), with women and younger individuals benefiting more significantly. Additionally, the duration of follow-up is a key factor influencing outcomes. The conclusions of this study can provide evidence-based guidance for the clinical treatment of prediabetic patients to prevent cardiovascular and microvascular complications.

                Although previous systematic reviews considered the relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, almost 200 peer‐reviewed articles have been published since the last review on that topic, and this paper focuses specifically on education, which has different implications. The authors systematically review the peer‐reviewed literature from around the world considering the association between educational attainment and obesity.

The relationship between educational attainment and obesity was modified by both gender and the country's economic development level: an inverse association was more common in studies of higher‐income countries and a positive association was more common in lower‐income countries, with stronger social patterning among women. Relatively few studies reported on lower‐income countries, controlled for a comprehensive set of potential confounding variables and/or attempted to assess causality through the use of quasi‐experimental designs. Future research should address these gaps to understand if the relationship between educational attainment and obesity may be causal, thus supporting education policy as a tool for obesity prevention.},

	abstract = {Many machine learning models have important structural tuning parameters that cannot be directly estimated from the data. The common tactic for setting these parameters is to use resampling methods, such as cross--validation or the bootstrap, to evaluate a candidate set of values and choose the best based on some pre--defined criterion. Unfortunately, this process can be time consuming. However, the model tuning process can be streamlined by adaptively resampling candidate values so that settings that are clearly sub-optimal can be discarded. The notion of futility analysis is introduced in this context. An example is shown that illustrates how adaptive resampling can be used to reduce training time. Simulation studies are used to understand how the potential speed--up is affected by parallel processing techniques.},
